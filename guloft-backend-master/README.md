## Problem Statement & Motivation
We want to help students find their roommate, since most of the school apartments are missing their roommate matching system. We found that many new students have encountered some problems and conflicts with their roommates, which greatly affect their school life. We want to solve this problem and convenience future students when they want to find a roommate.
